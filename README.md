# JavaScript Basic Problem Solving

This repository contains solutions to 10 fundamental JavaScript programming problems. These problems are commonly asked in beginner-level interviews and are designed to strengthen core concepts such as strings, arrays, loops, conditions, and basic logic building.

The goal of this project is clarity, simplicity, and interview-ready understanding rather than over-optimization.

## 🧠 Problem Explanations

### 1. Reverse a String

Reverses a given string by converting it to an array, reversing the array, and joining it back into a string.

### 2. Count Vowels in a String

Counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) exist in a given string using a loop and conditional check.

### 3. Check for Palindrome

Checks whether a string reads the same forward and backward by comparing it with its reversed version.

### 4. Find the Maximum Number

Finds the largest number in an array using JavaScript built-in functionality.

### 5. Remove Duplicates from an Array

Removes duplicate values from an array using `Set`, which stores only unique values.

### 6. Sum of All Numbers in an Array

Calculates the total sum of all numbers in an array using a loop.

### 7. Find Even Numbers in an Array

Filters and returns only even numbers from a given array.

### 8. Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

Capitalizes the first letter of every word in a sentence.

### 9. Factorial of a Number

Calculates the factorial of a number using a loop-based approach.

### 10. PingPong Challenge

Prints numbers from 1 to 20 with the following rules:

- Multiples of 3 → "Ping"
- Multiples of 5 → "Pong"
- Multiples of both 3 and 5 → "PingPong"
